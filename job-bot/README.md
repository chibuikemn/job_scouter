# Job Bot

Automated job search and matching system following the blueprint architecture.

## Setup (one-time)

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
```

2. Set up Google Sheets:
   - Create a Google Cloud project
   - Enable Google Sheets API
   - Download credentials.json
   - Create a sheet named "Job Applications"
   - share the sheet with the service account email (looks like xxx@xxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com)
   P.S: if you skip this it will fail

3. Configure job criteria in `config/requirements.json`

4. Run: `python main.py`

## MVP Features (Build Order)
